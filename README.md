This project, "Natural Savagery," which is adventure.py is not my original work. It is adapted from the code and design of the original author from Project_1. Full credit and recognition go to the creator for the concept, structure, and initial implementation.

Inheterince i have some like game logic it contain all the class inside then the logic inside the main

Encapsulation i dont have that. i dont have any restriction or security that set in the code

Methods like take_damage() or is_alive() used in both classes and called in the main game logic 

also in the code is the sword. sword have a lot of variation

I dont have Abstraction but in my definition its the oop pillar where the code does not need any explanation it will just work how it is base on the name.
