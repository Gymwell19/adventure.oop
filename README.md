This project, "Natural Savagery," is not my original work. It is adapted from the code and design of the original author from Project_1. Full credit and recognition go to the creator for the concept, structure, and initial implementation.

class Character: (base class, for inheritance)

class Player(Character): and class Werewolf(Character): (for inheritance and encapsulation)

Methods like take_damage() or is_alive() used in both classes and called in the main game logic (for polymorphism and abstraction).
